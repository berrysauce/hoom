!!! warning
    Hoom is still under development. It is not recommended at this point, to use Hoom in a production environment.


## What is Hoom?

Hoom is a Python package that allows you to easily build your own HomeKit Bridge & Accessories. It works with and is heavily inspired by [HAP-python](https://github.com/ikalchev/HAP-python) & [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi). To make the development of HomeKit compatible bridges as easy as possible, Hoom uses function decorators. This drastically simplifies the process. Hoom also comes with a minimalist web UI, which allows you to control your HomeKit Accessories from any device in your local network.
